description: How the OAuth device flow works and how to authenticate your Hytale server.
---

HyOS uses the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Flow to authenticate with the Hytale platform. This happens automatically on first run.

## How It Works

1. The container starts and detects no cached auth token
2. It initiates the OAuth device flow and displays a code in the logs
3. You visit the authorization URL, enter the code, and sign in with your Hytale account
4. The container receives an access token and caches it at `/data/.auth/tokens.json`
5. Subsequent restarts use the cached token (auto-refreshed when expired)

## First-Time Setup

Watch the container logs during first startup:

```bash
docker logs -f hyos-server
```

You will see output like:

```
[AUTH] Please visit: https://oauth.accounts.hytale.com/oauth2/device/verify
[AUTH] Enter code: ABCD-1234
[AUTH] Waiting for authorization...
```

Visit the URL, enter the code, and authorize. The server will continue automatically.

## Token Injection

For automated deployments (CI/CD, scaling), you can inject a pre-obtained token via environment variables:

```yaml
environment:
  - HYTALE_SERVER_SESSION_TOKEN=your-session-token
  - HYTALE_SERVER_IDENTITY_TOKEN=your-identity-token
  - HYTALE_OWNER_UUID=your-owner-uuid
```

This skips the interactive device flow entirely. See the [Configuration Reference](/docs/configuration) for details.

## Token Storage

Tokens are stored at `/data/.auth/tokens.json` inside the container. This path is within the mounted volume, so tokens persist across container restarts.

## Troubleshooting

- **Token expired and refresh fails**: Delete `/data/.auth/tokens.json` and restart the container to re-authenticate
- **Device flow times out**: The code expires after 15 minutes — restart the container to get a new code
- See [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting) for more authentication issues
