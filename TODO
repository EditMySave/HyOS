  1. Mod Search (Improvements)              
  Current state: Multi-provider search exists across CurseForge, Modtale, and NexusMods with aggregation, sorting, and pagination.   
  What to flesh out:                                                                                                                                     
  - Category/tag filtering - Add filters for mod categories (e.g., gameplay, building, utility) alongside the existing sort dropdown                     
  - Game version filtering - Filter by Hytale server version compatibility                                                                               
  - Provider toggle chips - Inline toggle buttons to enable/disable providers directly in the search bar (instead of opening settings dialog)            
  - Search result caching - Cache previous search results in Zustand so back-navigation doesn't re-fetch                                                 
  - Debounced live search - Auto-search as user types (with debounce) instead of requiring Enter/button click                                            
  - Result count per provider - Show "3 from CurseForge, 7 from Modtale" breakdown in results header

  2. TrueNAS Catalog                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                         
  Current state: TrueNAS deployment works via config-truenas with shell scripts and state files. No catalog entry exists.                                
                                                                                                                                                         
  What to build:                                                                                                                                         
  - TrueNAS SCALE catalog format - A catalog.json or ix-chart structure following TrueNAS custom app catalog spec (chart metadata, questions.yaml, app   
  version, icon)                                                                                                                                         
  - Questions schema - Defines all configurable env vars as TrueNAS UI form fields (server host, ports, JVM memory, mod paths, API credentials)          
  - Values defaults - Sensible defaults for TrueNAS deployment (volume mounts for /data, networking, resource limits)                                    
  - Upgrade strategy - Chart versioning that maps to hyOS Docker image tags                                                                              
  - Documentation page - In-catalog description, screenshots, and setup instructions                                                                     
  - Repository structure - Separate truenas-catalog/ directory at repo root with the standard stable/hyos/ chart hierarchy

SWR fetches GET /api/server/logs?tail=200 every 5 seconds.                                          
                                                                                                                                                         
  What to build:                                                                                                                                         
  - Configurable tail size - Dropdown or input to set tail count (200, 500, 1000, 5000, all)                                                             
  - Infinite scroll / load more - As user scrolls up, fetch older logs via offset pagination (?tail=200&before=<timestamp>)                              
  - Log file access - Read from historical log files in /data/server/logs/ (not just container stdout), with date picker to select which log file        
  - Virtual scrolling - Use react-window or @tanstack/react-virtual to handle rendering thousands of lines without DOM bloat                             
  - Export logs - Download filtered logs as .txt or .log file                                                                                            
  - Persistent scroll position - Remember position when switching tabs

Better Installed Mods Button Detection                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                         
  Current state: isModLoaded() in mods/page.tsx:153 matches by stripping .jar and doing a case-insensitive comparison against                            
  loadedPlugins.plugins[].name. In mod-browse.tsx:292, installed detection compares m.name === mod.latestVersion?.fileName.                              
                                                                                                                                                         
  Problems: The matching is fragile - mod filenames often include version strings (e.g., hytale-api-1.0.0.jar) that don't match plugin names (HytaleAPI).
   Browse page only checks filename exact match.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                         
  What to build:                                                                                                                                         
  - Fuzzy matching - Normalize names by stripping version numbers, hyphens, and casing: hytale-api-1.0.0.jar -> hytaleapi matches plugin HytaleAPI       
  - Metadata-based matching - Store a manifest (installed-mods.json) when installing from a provider that maps {provider, providerModId, fileName,       
  installedAt}. Then match browse results against provider+ID rather than filename                                                                       
  - Plugin ID matching - If the server API returns a plugin ID or namespace (e.g., com.hytale.HytaleAPI), match against that                             
  - Status indicators in browse results:                                                                                                                 
    - "Installed" (file exists and loaded)                                                                                                               
    - "Installed - Not Loaded" (file exists but plugin not in loaded list)                                                                               
    - "Update Available" (installed version < latest version)                                                                                            
    - "Install" (not installed)

  Current state: The ModCard component shows a "View on website" link only as a fallback when latestVersion is null (no installable version). When a mod 
  is installable, only the Install button shows.

  - Always show website link - Add a secondary "Visit" button alongside Install on every mod card                                                        
  - Layout: Primary Install button on the left, outline "Visit" icon button on the right                                                                 
  - For installed mods too - On the Installed tab, add a website link per mod (requires storing the websiteUrl in the install manifest)                  
  - Open in new tab - Already uses target="_blank" and rel="noreferrer"

  Current state: Config service reads/writes a manager config. No UI for editing the Hytale server's own config.json (server settings like ports, max    
  players, game rules).
